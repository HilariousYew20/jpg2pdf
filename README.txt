Hello;
First of all, thank you for choosing. There is a library that you must download in order to use the application. This library is the 'Pillow' library.
You can download the library by simply typing 'pip install pillow' in your console. If you encounter any problems, you can solve your problem by going to this link: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/.

In order for the program to print, it needs a folder named 'pdf' in the workspace. It uses there as output. After following these steps, the application will be ready to use. Contact me if you encounter any difficulties. I wish you a good day. I am waiting for your feedback.

Best regards;
Ali İhsan Sarı
